## Benchmarking FRB Search Software

Date: February 21, 2019
Time: 9:30 - 17:00
Location: University of Amsterdam

### Workshop program
* Opening by Liam
* Talk by Adriënne Mendrik (netherlands eScience center) “Introduction to Challenges and the EYRA Benchmark Platform” 
* Liam Connor (University of Amsterdam) “Introduction to the FRB Detection Benchmark Initiative”
* Coffee Break
* Brainstorm on the FRB Detection Benchmark:
  * Input: Filterbank (.fil) or other
  * Output: Text file
    * What should be in there? SN, dispersion, pulse width, arrival time, scattering measure, ...
    * How should it be structured?
* Benchmark data: 
* Different telescopes (what data can people contribute? How large?)
* Simulation of the FRBs
* What metrics should be used to rank the algorithms?
* Intersection over Union (IoU), etc?
* Lunch Break
* Break-out sessions
* Dockerize software
* Alessio and other eScience engineers will be present to assist in dockerizing the software
* Design Benchmark 
* A subset of people can work out (make a document) the FRB detection benchmark based on the brainstorm in the morning.
* Closing

Potential deliverables:
* Global benchmark design and an overview of existing data
* Some dockerized software packages


### Target Audience
* Algorithm developers with an interest to apply their algorithm to a benchmark
* Scientists interested in setting up a benchmark
* Anyone with an interest in how benchmarks can advance a scientific field

### Speakers

![Bram van Ginneken](/Bram_van_Ginneken2.jpg)
Bram van Ginneken is Professor of Medical Image Analysis at Radboud University Medical Center and chairs the Diagnostic Image Analysis Group. He pioneered the concept of challenges (algorithm benchmarks) in medical image analysis, by organizing the first two challenge workshops in 2007 at one of the leading international conferences (MICCAI) in the field, after which many followed. He initiated and maintains https://grand-challenge.org/ that currently list over 150 challenges organized by various researchers in the field. He is the driving force behind the [COMIC](https://grand-challenge.org/Create_your_own_challenge/) (Consortium for Open Medical Image Computing) platform, to easily set up websites for challenges in biomedical images analysis. At this tutorial, he will share his experiences with challenges in the biomedical image analysis field.

![Maria Eskevich](/Maria2.png)
Maria Eskevich is Central Office Coordinator at CLARIN ERIC (European Research Infrastructure for Language Resources and Technology). Since 2010 she has been highly interested in running the benchmarking evaluation campaigns for multimedia related tasks exploring how users can browse and discover intersting material within multimedia archives using both audio and visual features of the data. She has been organizer and co-organizer of many tasks (algorithm benchmarks) at MediaEval and TRECVID, including Rich Speech Retrieval (RSR) at MediaEval (2011), Search and Hyperlinking (S&H) at MediaEval (2012-2014), Search and Anchoring in Video Archives (SAVA) at MediaEval (2015), and Video Hyperlinking (LNK) at TRECVID (2015-2017). At this tutorial, she will share her experiences with shared tasks for multimedia evaluation.
